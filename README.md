This project accurately classified faces into two broad groups OCR methodology with Haar Cascade classifier on grayscale images, averaging hue and saturation information in an HSV color space with a K-Means clustering refinement. The scatter plot gives the visual representation of clustered features and centroids. Tracking of the experiments, version control, and containerization were done via the tools of WandB, GitHub, and Docker, which contributed to an efficient and reproducible workflow. This way illustrated the actual capabilities of using the image processing approaches, along with clustering techniques for face categorization.
